# Edge Detection on Grayscale Images

## Description
This project performs edge detection on grayscale images using MATLAB Image Processing Toolbox. Both Sobel and Canny edge detection techniques were applied and results compared.

## Tools Used
- MATLAB
- Image Processing Toolbox

## Implementation
1. Loaded images using `imread`.
2. Converted RGB images to grayscale using `rgb2gray`.
3. Applied Sobel and Canny edge detection using `edge` function.
4. Displayed original and edge-detected images side by side for comparison.

## Results
- Original vs Sobel edge-detected image:

- Original vs Canny edge-detected image:

## Key Learnings
- Basics of digital image processing.
- Understanding gradient-based edge detection (Sobel, Canny).
- MATLAB scripting and visualization.
